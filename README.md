# splunk-https-monitor
A start at learning a SIEM tool: splunk enterprise, in this project I understand the basics of how to add/search for data using SQL and using this to display results on a dashboard.

Starting I found a examplar log file which includes HTTPS log details from a website.

Using SPL queries to filter through the log file for important information that can be used in cybersecurity.

Also using these queries to create a dashboard (studio version) where i learnt how to design and customise a dashboard to display important events happening on the website.
